## Overview

Assuming at most one changepoint (AMOC), we conduct the single changepoint detection of mean shift in categorical time series via a likelihood ratio type statistic using the marginalized transition model. The mean shift along with the seasonal effects and the temporal trend is described in the marginal mean model, and the serial correlation is modeled separately through a first-order Markov chain.
